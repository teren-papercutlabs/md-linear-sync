# md-linear-sync

Sync Linear tickets to local markdown files with status-based folder organization. Features robust bidirectional sync, comment management, and consistent duplicate title handling.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g md-linear-sync
```

## Quick Start

Get started in 5 minutes:

```bash
# 1. Get your Linear API key from https://linear.app/settings/api

# 2. Initialize in your project directory
md-linear-sync init

# 3. Import existing tickets
md-linear-sync import

# 4. Edit files, then sync changes
md-linear-sync push PAP-431

# 5. Add comments to tickets

## Core Concepts

### How md-linear-sync Works

md-linear-sync creates a bidirectional bridge between Linear tickets and local markdown files. This tool is designed for **agentic coding workflows** where AI agents read and write tickets programmatically. For manual ticket management, Linear's web interface is more efficient.

**Sync mechanisms:**

- **CLI commands**: Create tickets from markdown files ([see Ticket Creation](#ticket-creation)) and push local changes to Linear ([see CLI Reference](#cli-reference))
- **Webhooks**: Real-time sync from Linear to local files - when tickets are created, edited, deleted, or commented on in Linear, the changes automatically update your local files and move them between status folders

#### The File-Folder Model

Each Linear ticket becomes a markdown file organized by your team's configured statuses:

```
md-linear-sync/
â””â”€â”€ linear-tickets/
    â”œâ”€â”€ todo/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PAP-431-implement-auth.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ in-progress/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PAP-430-user-dashboard.md
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PAP-430.432-dashboard-layout.md  # Child ticket
    â””â”€â”€ done/
        â””â”€â”€ PAP-429-setup-database.md
```

**Key principles:**

- **Status = Folder**: Moving files between folders updates Linear ticket status
- **Filename = Identity**: `PAP-431-implement-auth.md` maps to Linear ticket PAP-431
- **Parent-Child**: `PAP-430.432-child.md` shows PAP-432 is a child of PAP-430
- **Folder names match your team's Linear workflow states** (converted to lowercase with hyphens)

#### File Structure

Each ticket file contains three sections: **frontmatter** (ticket metadata), **ticket description**, and **comments**:

```markdown
---
title: Implement user authentication
status: In Progress
priority: 2
labels: [Feature, Backend]
linear_id: PAP-431
created_at: "2025-01-15T09:30:00.000Z"
url: https://linear.app/team/issue/PAP-431
---

## Description

Add JWT-based authentication with password reset flow.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Login endpoint with email/password
- [ ] JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Password reset via email

---comments---

- id: comment_123
  author: john@company.com  
  content: "Should we use refresh tokens too?"
  created_at: '2025-01-15T10:15:00.000Z'
```

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Linear account with API access
- Git repository for storing markdown files

### 1. Get Linear API Key

1. Go to [Linear Settings â†’ API](https://linear.app/settings/api)
2. Create a new Personal API key
3. Copy the key (starts with `lin_api_`)

### 2. Initialize Project

```bash
cd your-project-directory
md-linear-sync init
```

The setup wizard will:

- Prompt for your Linear API key
- Show your available teams (select one)
- Show available projects (select one or skip)
- Discover your team's workflow states
- Create folder structure and configuration files

### 3. Generated Files

After `init`, you'll have:

```
md-linear-sync/
â”œâ”€â”€ .linear-sync.json          # Project configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ linear-tickets/            # Status folders (matches your workflow)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ backlog/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ todo/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ in-progress/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ done/
â”œâ”€â”€ new-tickets/               # For creating new tickets
â”œâ”€â”€ .linear-ticket-format.md   # Template to be filled in with your desired ticket format
â”œâ”€â”€ create-linear-ticket.md    # Claude Code slash command
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                       # API key storage
â””â”€â”€ CLAUDE.md                  # AI context file (workflow guidance)
```

### 4. Import Existing Tickets

```bash
md-linear-sync import
```

This fetches all tickets from your Linear project and creates markdown files organized by status.

### 5. Bidirectional Sync Setup (Optional)

For automatic sync in both directions:

```bash
md-linear-sync start-sync
```

This enables:
- **File watching**: Moving files between status folders automatically updates Linear ticket status
- **Webhook sync**: Linear changes automatically update local files
- **Real-time updates**: Comments, status changes, and ticket creation sync immediately

The system uses ngrok tunneling and auto-restarts to handle session limits.

### 6. Slack Notifications (Optional)

Get notified of Linear changes in Slack:

```bash
md-linear-sync setup-slack
```

Follow the wizard to create a Slack app with proper permissions and set up a notification channel.

## Agentic Workflow

This tool is designed for AI agents to programmatically manage tickets:

### 1. Plan tickets with your agent

Work with your AI coding assistant to break down features into tickets.

### 2. Create tickets using the slash command

**Claude Code users**: Use the slash command:

```bash
/create-linear-ticket "Implement user authentication"
```

**Other AI tools**: Feed the contents of `md-linear-sync/create-linear-ticket.md` as a prompt to your agent. This file contains strict validation rules and examples.

**AI Context**: The `CLAUDE.md` file created during setup provides comprehensive workflow guidance for AI agents. Copy this to your AI tool's context files (e.g., .cursorrules, .ai-context) if not using Claude Code.

### 3. Agent validates and creates tickets

The agent should:

1. Write markdown files with proper frontmatter
2. Run `md-linear-sync validate filename.md --json`
3. Fix any validation errors and re-validate - if there are any errors, validate returns them in machine-readable format for the agent to iterate until they pass
4. Only when validation passes: run `md-linear-sync create` (or `md-linear-sync create folder/` if tickets are in a specific folder) to create the tickets in Linear

### 4. Files automatically sync

- Created tickets move to appropriate status folders
- Linear changes sync back to local files via webhooks
- Agents can read ticket status by checking folder location
